## Project Status
This project was developed as part of Texas Convergent's build teams which is a semester-long competition. While there are still a lot of features that could be added, given the time constraints, the features implemented are the ones that were presented. There are no further plans to continue building this project.

## Reflection
This project as previously mentioned was a part of the Texas Convergent Build Teams program and my team came up with this application idea because we as college students recognized some of the inefficiencies that arose around large events and executing them. We all learned a lot about mobile app development as well as a lot of different technologies that we will utilize in the future.

This project was challenging because this was one of the first times we'd used React Native before as well as Javascript to create a full-fledged project. We used a lot of the core features of React to implement this app but it was all a learning process that landed us an honorable mention at the Texas Convergent Demo Day.

The technologies we used were React Native, Expo, and Javascript. We chose to use React Native as it has become one of the leaders of mobile app development in terms of creating responsive applications because of its ease of use and straightforwardness. We used expo to help test our application in different environments, and since we were developing this for mobile, we needed expo.
